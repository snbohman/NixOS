# Snbohmans nixos dotfiles
Nixos dotfiles based on richen604s
[Hydenix](https://github.com/richen604/hydenix) template.

Install this as any other dotfile flake. If you're new to nixos, follow the
hydenix instructions on installation. For ease of use I have provided a
rebuilt.sh script. Make sure to initialize a git repository before using it.
